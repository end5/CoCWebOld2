Once you feel comfortable, the forest is probably the next safest area, but beware of tentacle monsters.  The desert is the next toughest area, and the mountains offer further challenges.  There are more areas beyond that, but that's a good way to get started.  You'll uncover plenty of new 'places' exploring, which can be accessed from the <b>Places</b> menu.  You'll also find some interesting characters when you try to discover new explorable locations by choosing <b>Explore</b> twice.\n\n");
