Shrugging, you slide your arms into the sleeves, sticking your middle fingers through the extended ends.  Golden embroidery down their length contains some of the most ornate and stylized pictures of dicks you have ever seen, culminating in an excessive amount of gold thread splayed in your palm, symbolizing the ejaculate.  You lift your chin to fit the posture collar in place, completely hiding your neck from view as you lace it from behind.  The dark red works nicely with your " + charcter.body.skin.tone + " " + charcter.body.skin.desc + ".

The belt practically attaches to the corset as though it were made to be a single article of clothing, clasping beneath a set of heavily stylized golden lines that you suspect are meant to be a face in the middle of either prayer or oral sex, or possibly both.\n\n");

Golden trim takes on the form of waving and twisting tentacles as the bottom of the skirt gets closer, looking as though it wants to burst from the fabric and molest its wearer.\n\n");

If what the note said is true, and the armor adapts to he who finds it, perhaps even hooves and paws could have fit, given enough magical power used in the creation.  Laces run up the side of each boot all the way to your thighs, resembling the corset they were paired with.
