    /*Purified LaBova:
     This will be one of the items that the character will have to give Marble to purify her, but there is a limit on how much she can be purified in this way.
     Effects on the character:
     Mostly the same, but without animal transforms, corruption, and lower limits on body changes
     Hips and ass cap at half the value for LaBova
     Nipple growth caps at 1 inch
     Breasts cap at E or DD cup
     Raises lactation to a relatively low level, reduces high levels: \"Your breasts suddenly feel less full, it seems you aren't lactating at quite the level you where.\"  OR  \"The insides of your breasts suddenly feel bloated.  There is a spray of milk from them, and they settle closer to a more natural level of lactation.\"
     Does not apply the addictive quality
     If the character has the addictive quality, this item can remove that effect

     Enhanced LaBova:
     Something that the character can either make or find later; put it in whenever you want, or make your own item.  This is just a possible suggestion.  If it is given to Marble, she only gains the quad nipples.
     Effects on the character
     Mostly the same, but some of the effects can be more pronounced.  Ie, more str gain from one dose, or more breast growth.
     If the character's nipples are larger than 1 inch in length, this item is guaranteed to give them quad nipples.  This applies to all their breasts; seems like it ould be a good compromise on whether or not cowgirls should have 4 breasts.
     Very small chance to increase fertility (normally this increase would only happen when the character forces a creature to drink their milk).
