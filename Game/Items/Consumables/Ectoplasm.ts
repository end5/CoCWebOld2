// Miscellaneous
// ITEM GAINED FROM LUST WINS
// bottle of ectoplasm. Regular stat-stuff include higher speed, (reduced libido?), reduced sensitivity, and higher intelligence. First-tier effects include 50/50 chance of sable skin with bone-white veins or ivory skin with onyx veins. Second tier, \"wisp-like legs that flit back and forth between worlds,\" or \"wisp-like legs\" for short. Third tier gives an \"Ephemeral\" perk, makes you (10%, perhaps?) tougher to hit, and gives you a skill that replaces tease/seduceï¿½allowing the PC to possess the creature and force it to masturbate to gain lust. Around the same effectiveness as seduce.
